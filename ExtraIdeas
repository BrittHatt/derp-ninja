- Allow threads to have "primary" and "tertiary" users. The thread may show differently on the home page depending on the user type.
- Allow a user to easily see messages previously sent
- Allow users (maybe only primary users) to break off a thread at a given message into a new thread. (IE: when a convo gets off topic.)
- Need to have ability to manage user groups; a user may add an entire message group to a thread then.
